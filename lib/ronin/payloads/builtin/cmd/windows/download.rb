            Uses the `certutil` Windows command to download a URL and save it
            to a sepcific destination file.

            The technique of using builtin system utilities for alternative
            purposes is known as Living Off The Land (LOTL). These builtin
            system binaries, which can be used for alternative purposes, are
            known as "LOLbins".
