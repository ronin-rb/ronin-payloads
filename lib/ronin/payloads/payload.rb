module Ronin
  module Payloads
    #
    # The {Payload} class allows for describing payloads, which are
    # delivered via exploits, purely in Ruby. Payloads contain metadata
    # about the payload and methods which define the functionality of the
    # payload. Payloads may also be coupled with exploits, or chained
    # together with other payloads.
    #
    # ## Payload API Methods
    #
    # * {Payload#initialize initialize} - Initializes a new instance of the
    #   payload.
    # * {Payload#build build} - contains the logic to build the payload. The
    #   built payload must be stored in the `@payload` instance variable.
    # * {Payload#prelaunch prelaunch} - contains additional logic that runs
    #   before the payload has been launched by the exploit.
    # * {Payload#postlaunch postlaunch} - contains additional logic that runs
    #   after the payload has been launched by the exploit.
    # * {Payload#cleanup cleanup} - contains additional logic to cleanup or
    #   shutdown the payload.
    #
    # ## Example
    #
    #     module Ronin
    #       module Payloads

    #             This is my first payload.
    #             Bla bla bla bla.
